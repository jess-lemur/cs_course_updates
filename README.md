# CS 1.2: Introduction to Data Structures


## Description

This course looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how arrays, linked lists and hash tables work. Students will build these structures from scratch, analyze complexity, and benchmark performance in an application to gain an understanding of real-world tradeoffs. Students will write scripts, functions, and library modules to use text processing tools like regular expressions, construct and sample probability distributions to create a Markov language model and gain insight into how grammar works and introductory natural language processing techniques.

# CS 1.3: Core Data Structures and Algorithms


## Description

This course explores the foundations of computer science including discrete mathematics, abstract data types, data structures, and algorithm analysis and design. Students will compare and contrast iterative and recursive algorithms to analyze design and performance tradeoffs. Students will implement and test data structures including lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and trees. Students will then apply these to real-world problems like phone call routing to understand their tradeoffs. Students will also write technical blog articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.

# CS 2.1: Advanced Trees and Sorting Algorithms


## Description

In this course students will implement and test advanced data structures and algorithms, analyze algorithmic complexity, benchmark performance in time and memory usage, and draw out elegant problem-solving techniques. Key concepts include divide-and-conquer recursion, sorting algorithms, heaps, tries, n-ary trees, and self-balancing trees. Students will build an original project that applies these data structures to real-world problems such as autocomplete, expression parsing, and phylogenetic trees. Students will also write technical blog articles about these topics to deepen understanding, improve technical writing, and bolster their online presence as knowledgeable and proficient software engineers.
